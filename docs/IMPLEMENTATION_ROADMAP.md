## Notes
- Focus on completing core features before moving to advanced features
- Each component should be fully tested before moving to the next
- Maintain performance while adding features
- Regular commits with meaningful messages
- Code review after each major feature

## Development Guidelines
1. Complete one feature before moving to the next
2. Test thoroughly after each implementation
3. Maintain code quality and documentation
4. Consider mobile experience throughout
5. Keep bundle size in check
