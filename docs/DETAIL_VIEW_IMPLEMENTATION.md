# Detail View Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Pokemon detail view, which includes stats visualization, type information, weaknesses, and evolution chain.

## Components Breakdown

### 1. Stats Section
- [ ] Create `StatsChart` component
  - [ ] Implement bar chart visualization for 6 base stats
  - [ ] Add labels (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed)
  - [ ] Add stat values
  - [ ] Style with appropriate colors and animations
  - [ ] Add responsive design for mobile view

### 2. Type & Weaknesses Section
- [x] Create `TypeSection` component
  - [x] Reuse existing TypeBadge components
  - [ ] Implement type layout as shown in mockup
- [ ] Create `WeaknessesSection` component
  - [x] Calculate and display weakness types (already implemented in usePokemon hook)
  - [ ] Style weakness badges
  - [ ] Add hover effects/tooltips for multipliers

### 3. Evolution Chain ✅
- [x] Create `EvolutionChain` component
  - [x] Implement circular Pokemon portraits with white background
  - [x] Add Pokemon numbers (#0001 format)
  - [x] Add Pokemon names
  - [x] Create evolution arrow indicators
  - [x] Add type badges below each Pokemon
  - [x] Make evolution chain items clickable/navigable
  - [x] Handle cases with multiple evolution paths
  - [x] Add loading states for evolution chain data
  - [x] Add proper level indicators between evolutions
  - [x] Style with dark striped background
  - [x] Implement proper spacing and layout
  - [x] Add responsive design for mobile view

### 4. API Integration ✅
- [x] Basic Pokemon API service
  - [x] Endpoint for basic Pokemon data
  - [x] Type and weakness data fetching
  - [x] Stats data fetching
- [x] Additional API endpoints
  - [x] Add endpoint for evolution chain data
  - [x] Implement data transformation for evolution chain
  - [x] Add localStorage caching for evolution data
- [x] Create new API hooks
  - [x] `useEvolutionChain` hook with proper caching
  - [x] `usePokemonStats` hook (partially implemented in usePokemon)

### 5. Layout & Styling
- [x] Create responsive grid layout
- [x] Implement dark mode support for evolution chain
- [x] Add smooth transitions and animations
- [x] Ensure consistent spacing and alignment
- [x] Add loading skeletons for all sections

### 6. Performance Optimization ✅
- [x] Implement lazy loading for images (OptimizedImage component exists)
- [x] Add proper error boundaries (ErrorBoundary component exists)
- [x] Memoize expensive calculations (usePokemonCache exists)
- [x] Optimize re-renders for detail view
- [x] Add localStorage caching for evolution chain data
- [x] Handle loading and error states properly

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for stat calculations
- [ ] Integration tests for evolution chain
- [ ] Test different Pokemon edge cases
  - [ ] Pokemon with no evolutions
  - [ ] Pokemon with multiple evolution paths
  - [ ] Pokemon with special evolution conditions

### 8. Polish & Accessibility
- [ ] Add tooltips for stats
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Ensure proper color contrast
- [x] Add loading and error states (components exist)

## Implementation Priority
1. ✅ Evolution Chain API Integration (Foundation)
2. Stats Section (Core Visual)
3. ✅ Evolution Chain UI (Complex Visual)
4. Type & Weaknesses Layout
5. Layout & Styling
6. ✅ Performance Optimization
7. Testing
8. Polish & Accessibility

## Notes
- Each component should be developed with mobile-first approach
- Maintain consistent styling with existing components
- Follow established patterns for error handling and loading states
- Keep accessibility in mind throughout development
- Document any complex logic or calculations
- Leverage existing components like TypeBadge, LoadingSpinner, and ErrorBoundary
- Use the existing Pokemon caching system for evolution chain data

## Evolution Chain Implementation Details
1. Data Flow:
   - Fetch species data to get evolution chain URL
   - Fetch evolution chain data
   - Transform data into flat structure with proper level information
   - Cache results in localStorage

2. UI Components:
   - Circular Pokemon portraits with white background
   - Level indicators above evolution arrows
   - Dark striped background for container
   - Responsive layout for all screen sizes

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Cache evolution data to reduce API calls
   - Lazy load Pokemon images
   - Handle loading and error states gracefully
   - Optimize re-renders with proper React patterns
