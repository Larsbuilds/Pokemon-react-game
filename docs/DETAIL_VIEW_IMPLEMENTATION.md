  - [x] Consistent sizing across all badges

### 6. Performance Optimization ✅
- [x] Implement lazy loading for images (OptimizedImage component exists)
- [x] Add proper error boundaries (ErrorBoundary component exists)
- [x] Memoize expensive calculations (usePokemonCache exists)

- [x] Handle loading and error states properly

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for stat calculations
- [ ] Integration tests for evolution chain
- [ ] Test different Pokemon edge cases
  - [ ] Pokemon with no evolutions
  - [ ] Pokemon with multiple evolution paths
  - [ ] Pokemon with special evolution conditions
- [ ] Test badge consistency
  - [ ] Verify type and weakness badge sizing
  - [ ] Test hover effects and transitions
  - [ ] Check color accessibility
- [ ] Test stats visualization
  - [ ] Verify stat calculations
  - [ ] Test tooltip behavior
  - [ ] Check keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Verify accessibility features

### 8. Polish & Accessibility
- [x] Add tooltips for stats
- [x] Implement keyboard navigation
- [x] Add proper ARIA labels
- [x] Ensure proper color contrast
- [x] Add loading and error states (components exist)
- [ ] Add tooltips for weakness multipliers
- [x] Improve focus indicators for interactive elements

## Implementation Priority
1. ✅ Evolution Chain API Integration (Foundation)
2. ✅ Stats Section (Core Visual)
3. ✅ Evolution Chain UI (Complex Visual)
4. ✅ Type & Weaknesses Layout
5. ✅ Layout & Styling
6. ✅ Performance Optimization
7. Testing
8. Polish & Accessibility

## Notes
- Each component should be developed with mobile-first approach
- Maintain consistent styling with existing components
- Follow established patterns for error handling and loading states
- Keep accessibility in mind throughout development
- Document any complex logic or calculations
- Leverage existing components like TypeBadge, LoadingSpinner, and ErrorBoundary
- Use the existing Pokemon caching system for evolution chain data

## Evolution Chain Implementation Details
1. Data Flow:
   - Fetch species data to get evolution chain URL
   - Fetch evolution chain data
   - Transform data into flat structure with proper level information
   - Cache results in localStorage

2. UI Components:
   - Circular Pokemon portraits with white background
   - Level indicators above evolution arrows
   - Dark striped background for container
   - Responsive layout for all screen sizes

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Cache evolution data to reduce API calls
   - Lazy load Pokemon images
   - Handle loading and error states gracefully
   - Optimize re-renders with proper React patterns

## Type & Weakness Badge Implementation Details
1. Badge Styling:
   - Consistent size for all badges (px-3 py-1)
   - Rounded corners (rounded-full)
   - Hover effects (scale-105)
   - Shadow on hover
   - Text size (text-sm)
   - Proper spacing between badges (gap-2)

2. Layout:
   - Types stacked vertically
   - Weaknesses wrap horizontally
   - Proper alignment with section headers
   - Responsive grid layout

3. Performance:
   - Efficient color mapping
   - Smooth transitions
   - Optimized re-renders
