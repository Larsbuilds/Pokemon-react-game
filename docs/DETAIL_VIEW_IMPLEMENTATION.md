# Detail View Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Pokemon detail view, which includes stats visualization, type information, weaknesses, and evolution chain.

## Components Breakdown

### 1. Stats Section
- [ ] Create `StatsChart` component
  - [ ] Implement bar chart visualization for 6 base stats
  - [ ] Add labels (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed)
  - [ ] Add stat values
  - [ ] Style with appropriate colors and animations
  - [ ] Add responsive design for mobile view

### 2. Type & Weaknesses Section
- [x] Create `TypeSection` component
  - [x] Reuse existing TypeBadge components
  - [ ] Implement type layout as shown in mockup
- [ ] Create `WeaknessesSection` component
  - [x] Calculate and display weakness types (already implemented in usePokemon hook)
  - [ ] Style weakness badges
  - [ ] Add hover effects/tooltips for multipliers

### 3. Evolution Chain
- [ ] Create `EvolutionChain` component
  - [ ] Implement circular Pokemon portraits
  - [ ] Add Pokemon numbers (#0001 format)
  - [ ] Add Pokemon names
  - [ ] Create evolution arrow indicators
  - [ ] Add type badges below each Pokemon
  - [ ] Make evolution chain items clickable/navigable
  - [ ] Handle cases with multiple evolution paths
  - [ ] Add loading states for evolution chain data

### 4. API Integration
- [x] Basic Pokemon API service
  - [x] Endpoint for basic Pokemon data
  - [x] Type and weakness data fetching
  - [x] Stats data fetching
- [ ] Additional API endpoints
  - [ ] Add endpoint for evolution chain data
  - [ ] Implement data transformation for evolution chain
  - [ ] Add caching for evolution data
- [ ] Create new API hooks
  - [ ] `useEvolutionChain` hook
  - [x] `usePokemonStats` hook (partially implemented in usePokemon)

### 5. Layout & Styling
- [ ] Create responsive grid layout
- [ ] Implement dark mode support
- [ ] Add smooth transitions and animations
- [ ] Ensure consistent spacing and alignment
- [x] Add loading skeletons for all sections (LoadingSpinner component exists)

### 6. Performance Optimization
- [x] Implement lazy loading for images (OptimizedImage component exists)
- [x] Add proper error boundaries (ErrorBoundary component exists)
- [x] Memoize expensive calculations (usePokemonCache exists)
- [ ] Optimize re-renders for detail view

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for stat calculations
- [ ] Integration tests for evolution chain
- [ ] Test different Pokemon edge cases
  - [ ] Pokemon with no evolutions
  - [ ] Pokemon with multiple evolution paths
  - [ ] Pokemon with special evolution conditions

### 8. Polish & Accessibility
- [ ] Add tooltips for stats
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Ensure proper color contrast
- [x] Add loading and error states (components exist)

## Implementation Priority
1. Evolution Chain API Integration (Foundation)
2. Stats Section (Core Visual)
3. Evolution Chain UI (Complex Visual)
4. Type & Weaknesses Layout
5. Layout & Styling
6. Performance Optimization
7. Testing
8. Polish & Accessibility

## Notes
- Each component should be developed with mobile-first approach
- Maintain consistent styling with existing components
- Follow established patterns for error handling and loading states
- Keep accessibility in mind throughout development
- Document any complex logic or calculations
- Leverage existing components like TypeBadge, LoadingSpinner, and ErrorBoundary
- Use the existing Pokemon caching system for evolution chain data
